# ansible-ipfs
Quick and easy playbook for installing an IPFS node/gateway as a service

If you are looking for a way of deploying and managing a cluster of ipfs nodes via ansible, you might like my other project, [ipfs-kloud](https://github.com/insanity54/ipfs-kloud)


## What it does

* install pre-built ipfs binary
* create ipfs system service
* run ipfs service
  * ipfs daemon using standard ports 4001, 5001, 8080



## What it does not do

* set up FUSE (could be implemented if there's interest.)
