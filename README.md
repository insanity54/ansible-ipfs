# ansible-ipfs
Quick and easy playbook for running an IPFS node/gateway

Work in progress


## What it does

* install pre-built ipfs binary
* create ipfs system service
* run ipfs service
  * ipfs daemon using standard ports 4001, 5001, 8080



## What it does not do

* set up FUSE (could be implemented if there's interest.)
